  This is the home of Michael Wagner's prosodylab, at the McGill Department of Linguistics. There are other labs working on prosody in our department, check out the labs of Meghan Clayards, Francisco Torreira, and Morgan Sonderegger. 
</p>

'Prosody' encompasses all those acoustic aspects of an utterance that are not due to the choice of words, but reflect syntactic grouping, emphasis, negotiate turn-taking, reflect emotional attitude, or distinguish different speech acts. 

If you speak through a kazoo (see the picture on the left), what you hear gives you a good idea what prosody is, since you will no longer be able to identify the words. Of course, even then the signal is shaped a lot by the choice words, for example the length of the words and how you position your tongue when you say them will still affect the signal. But the overall tune of the utterance will be much easier to hear, as well as how words group together, and where you place emphasis.

Our research addresses two key questions: (i) What information about speaker and context is reflected in prosody? (ii) How much of this information is retrieved by the listener, and how is it used in speech processing?

Prosody is partly the result of processing effects, such as planning and lexical retrieval, and partly it is itself part of the message, encodes important information. We all have internalized intricate conventions about prosody, just like we have internalized conventions about what particular words mean and how they can be combined to form sentences. So part of our research is trying to better understand how languages differ in their prosodic grammars.

Investigating prosody requires integrating insights from different disciplines, including psycho-linguistics experimentation, signal processing, and modelling the semantics and pragmatics, and our lab tries to do just that...
